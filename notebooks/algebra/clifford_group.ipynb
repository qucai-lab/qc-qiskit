    "- **Clifford gate:** is an element of the Clifford group, i.e, is a unitary matrix that can be decomposed/constructed into/from Paulis, $S$, $H$, and $CNOT$ gates up to a phase.

    "According to the [Gottesman–Knill theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottesman%E2%80%93Knill_theorem), a stabilizer circuit, i.e, a circuit composed only of gates from the Clifford set, can be efficiently simulated (in polynomial time) in a classical computer via a Clifford simulator [[1]](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.70.052328). For this reason, the Clifford set is the main gate set used in machine learning-based quantum error mitigation. One example is the [CDR error mitigation technique](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/cdr-4-low-level.html) used to approximate a target quantum circuit. "
