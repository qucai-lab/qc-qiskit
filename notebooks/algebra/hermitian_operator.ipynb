In quantum mechanics, physical observables (e.g., position, momentum, energy/hamiltonian, etc.) are represented by Hermitian operators since they have real eigenvalues, which is essential because measurement results are real numbers. Eigenvalues correspond to possible outcomes of measuring the observable, and eigenvectors correspond to the associated quantum states after measurement."
