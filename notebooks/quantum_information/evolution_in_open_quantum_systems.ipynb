[1]) consists of an ensemble (statistical mixture) of $N$ pure states ($\\{p_j, |\\psi_j\\rangle\\}_{j=1}^n$), a mixed state cannot be represented by a linear combination of the aforementioned normalized state vectors (pure states) that are defined on a separable Hilbert Space. Therefore, the evolved mixed state must be represented by a mixed density operator rather than a statevector."
