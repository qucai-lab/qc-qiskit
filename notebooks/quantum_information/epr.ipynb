    "In considering Max Born's probabilistic interpretation of the wave function, Albert Einstein addressed the mechanism of the wave function collapse during discussions at the 1927 Solvay conference. Einstein's gedanken (thought experiment) considered the diffraction of a beam of a single electron passing through a pinhole. According to the principle of superposition, before the electron hits a screen, the wave function in the position space represents the superposition of all the eigenstates associated with the positions available to the electron on that screen. The act of measurement would then cause the wave function to collapse to a single eingestate of the position observable. Einstein referred to this mechanism by which the wave function is instantly updated as action at a distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Einstein went further with his hypothesis that quantum mechanics was incomplete and published, among three other physicists, the so-called EPR paper in 1935. The paper devised a thought experiment considering a system of two entangled particles to assess whether a measurement in one particle would have an instantaneous effect on the other. The starting point of the EPR paper adopts the following definitions regarding the quantum mechanical theory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Realism:` every element of reality in nature (the so-called observables) must be predicted within the quantum theory without causing any disturbance to the quantum system. That is, it should be possible to predict the outcome of a measurement with 100\\% certainty before the measurement is even realized.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `Self-consistency:` a quantum theory shall be able to predict and explain experimental data in a consistent manner, i.e., free of contradictions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `Completeness:` a complete quantum theory is such that there is a theoretical analog for every element of reality in nature.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `Locality:` a measurement in one subsystem should not influence the outcome of a measurement in another subsystem."

    "1. If quantum mechanics were complete, then non-commuting (conjugate) observables $\\hat{A}$ and $\\hat{B}$ (e.g. spin $\\hat{\\sigma}_x$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}_z$) could not have simultaneous elements of reality.\n",
