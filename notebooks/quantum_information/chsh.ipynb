    "In 1964, John Bell proposed a deterministic local hidden variable model (LHVM) to assess the claims put forward by the EPR paper. Bell's approach considered a generic statistical theory (that is, not necessarily related to quantum mechanics) with notions of a probability distribution $p(\\lambda)$ of a sample space $\\Lambda$ with hidden variables $\\lambda$. Restricting the case for a bipartite system, the model allowed the possibility of measuring variables (observables) $A_1$ and $A_2$ in subsystem $A$, and variables $B_1$ and $B_2$ in subsystem $B$ with probability outcomes $a_1, a_2$ and $b_1, b_2$, respectively, sharing the following relation:\n",

    "- Aspect et al. were the first to verify experimentally the violation of Bell's inequality. However, to ensure that the state of particle $q_2$ is instantly determined once the state of particle $q_1$ is measured, the experiment must be carried out during a time window shorter than the time taken by any possible contaminating information traveling from one particle to the other at the speed of light and which could influence the result of a measurement. \n",

    "- The first loophole-free experiment of this kind was only carried out by Hensen et al., in 2015, reporting a violation of the CHSH inequality. The experiment consisted of spin-like particles separated by a distance of $1,280m$ setting a $4.27$-$ms$ time window during which two local events are space-like separated. The experimental evidence that certain entangled states do violate Bell's inequality confirms that locality and realism known together as local-realism cannot be simultaneously satisfied."
